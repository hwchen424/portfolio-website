          <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
          <p>
            We all need the advice of an expert sometimes, and how-to videos don’t always cut it.
            Users that want to learn new skills may spend hours looking up reliable guides or
            videos only to run out of motivation when they finally find a good source.
            They may spend an absorbent amount of money and energy only to be disappointed with
            their results
          </p>
          <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
          <p>
            An app that gives users a simple, intuitive way to connect with an expert in nearly
            any field within seconds so they can feel more informed and more prepared to face their
            everyday problems.
          </p>
          <h3>Why?</h3>
          <p>
            People are always trying to learn new skills but it can be costly in both time and
            money. Users wanting to learn new skills need a way to access reliable information
            quickly because they want to spend the least amount of time and effort learning a new
            topic in their busy lives
          </p>

          <p>
            Prior to beginning my design, I surveyed 18
            people and interviewed 3 participants. These are
            the questions I asked.
            <ul>
              <li>Attitudes on digital communication apps that support video and voice calling</li>
              <li>Attitudes on finding help from another person when faced with an issue</li>
              <li>Challenges of finding appropriate information by themselves</li>
              <li>Preferences for using digital communication apps</li>
            </ul>
            This is the data I gained from the surveys.

          </div>
          <p>
            After interviewing the 3 participants, I created personas based on data from both the surveys and interviews.

          <h3>Insights</h3>
          <p>
            From the data collected from the surveys and interviews, here are a few of the insights I made.
            <ul>
              <li>There is a preference for voice calls over video when communicating digitally. It may be important to give users the option to show their face or not depending on their preferences.</li>
              <li>Participants tend to seek out in-person help when the issue is too complicated to Google. As such, this app should try to accommodate questions that users can’t simply answer with a quick search.</li>
              <li>Many of the participants are familiar with the Zoom UI layout for their video calling software. Therefore, it may help users learn the layout of the video call functions by basing it on something familiar.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>Ideation</h3>
          <p>
            I made a sitemap from the data I obtained from a card sorting experiment with 5 different participants.
          </p>
          <div>

          </div>

          <h3>Wireframe</h3>
          <p>
            Based on the sitemap, I made wireframes for Expert. From left to right, these are the: lo-fidelity, mid-fidelity, high-fidelity prototype and the current product.

          <h3>Usability Tests</h3>
          <p>
            I conducted usability tests with 6 participants on the following aspects of the prototype:
            <ul>
              <li>How users navigate the app’s functions</li>
              <li>If users can understand the app’s iconography and text</li>
              <li>How effortlessly the user is able to complete their assigned scenario tasks.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h4>How effortlessly the user is able to complete their assigned scenario tasks.</h4>
          <p>
            All participants initially were confused about the difference between Matching and Browsing.
            Once the participants were able to differentiate between the two functions, they were able to
            complete their tasks with more confidence.

          </div>
          <ol>
            <li>I replaced the search bar with two buttons for “Match” and “Browse”. Each button has a description for the flow so it gives the user an idea of what they do.</li>
            <li>I changed the semantics so“Browse” became “Explore”. This decision was made in tandem with Issue 3.</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>Issue 2 - Some users felt uncomfortable talking with another person through video chat.</h4>
          <p>
            One participant felt that the user flow of matching with an expert and getting called immediately was weird and
            uncomfortable. Another participant has anxiety talking via video chat.

            </picture>
          </div>
          <ol>
            <li>I changed the user flow so the user does not immediately connect with an Expert. Instead, the Expert reaches out to the user and the user can accept the call upon viewing the message.</li>
            <li>Instead of defaulting to video, users can choose to take the call as a voice call, video call or even direct messaging. Some options may be greyed out based on the Expert’s preferences.</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>Issue 3 - Users preferred browsing the list of experts on the browse page instead of using the search bar.</h4>
          <p>
            When tasked to search for an Expert in the field of technology, most participants tried scrolling through the suggested experts
            rather than using the search bar.

            </picture>
          </div>
          <ol>
            <li>Since my users preferred going through the feed to look for experts, I redesigned the entire page so that the search bar is less emphasized (not in the middle) and created more options for the feed.</li>
            <li>This was also part of the process where I wanted to change the navigation style from a hamburger menu to a bottom navigation bar so I made this screen with the intention of having one.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
          <h4>Slowing it down in Interviews</h4>
          <p>My first few interviews with participants went way too quickly because I was nervous. I talked too quickly and stuck exclusively to
            the script. I found that if I viewed the process conversation, I would be less anxious and explore outside of the script.</p>
          <h4>Don’t overcommit to an idea</h4>
          <p>I was really stubborn with wanting a hamburger menu initially because it made the most sense at the time. As time passed, it started to dawn on me that a bottom navigation bar was better. Because I already designed my wireframes for a hamburger menu, I had to redo the header of all of my wireframes again. I should have made two separate wireframes initially and thought it through more.<p>
          <h4>Less is more” is overrated. Sometimes more really is more.</h4>
          <p>My lo-fi wireframes had a lot of images and very little text. I was going for that minimalist look but during my usability tests, I found that it made the initial experience frustrating. As the designer, I already knew what my app did, but my participants do not. As such, I learned the importance of adding subtexts for features, especially if they are the main functions of my app.</p>
