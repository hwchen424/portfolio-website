        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>
          Incoming USF freshmen and visitors find it difficult to navigate around campus. This can be especially stressful since University can be a fast-paced environment where punctuality is
          a necessary part of everyday campus life. As such, not being able to find the location of your classes, printers or cafes can be a huge impediment to a student’s day.
        </p>
        <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
          Students are always constrained by time and giving them a way to cut back on the time they need to spend navigating a new and unfamiliar campus can reduce the stress they feel during their first semester at school. Furthermore, by giving
          them information about the different

        <h3>Interviews</h3>
        <p>
          We interviewed Freshman and Sophomore Students that live on campus since these two groups made up the majority of students that lived on campus. The questions that we asked were used to determine the following about the participants:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Their knowledge of campus buildings</li>
          <li>Their perceived ease of getting from point A to B</li>
          <li>Their perceived ease of getting from point A to B</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>
          We developed two personas to represent the two cohorts that were interviewed. These are the personas.

        <!--<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
        <h4>Old Data can still be used</h4>
        <p></p>
        <h4>Sometimes it’s faster and better to create your own images</h4>
        <p>My biggest issue in this redesign was finding resources for the actual map of my school. I tried to google, I screenshotted maps on my school website and I even looked at old construction documents of my school (we’re built on an old
          cemetery. crazy right?). They all did not fit my needs. At the end of the day, I just traced a map using vectors and it actually ended up looking good. I can then add my own elements to the map to fit the needs of my users.
        <p>
        <h4>Even I could make a polished design</h4>
        <p>It was surreal to go back and review one of my older projects in Uni and I realized how sheltered I was from the world of design. As the sole Psychology major in the group, my main role in this project was user research. As such, I was
          amazed by the maps that my team members made because it was far beyond something I would ever be able to do. Now that I’ve gained competence with Adobe XD and Figma, I feel confident in being able to recreate those wireframes.</p>
